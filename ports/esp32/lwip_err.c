//
// Micropython note: this is a copy of ESP-IDFv4.0's components/lwip/lwip/src/api/err.c with
// the error EXXX constants replaced by MicroPython's to avoid getting the wrong values because
// ESP-IDFv4.0 uses ones from newlib (in components/newlib) that have a bunch of different values.
// It is assumed that ESP-IDFv4.1 fixes this discrepancy.
